# DeleGate

DeleGate is wallet with role management with attestation.

## Description

DeleGate allows designated accounts to manage access to a wallet with complete transparency. This infrastructure supports the automation of processes and is particularly useful for team management in decentralized environments. The system ensures that only authorized individuals can access wallet functionalities based on roles defined via smart contracts.

## How It Works

DeleGate operates on the Arbitrum Sepolia network and utilizes the following technologies:

- **Smart Contract Wallet**: Deployed on Arbitrum Sepolia to leverage its lower gas costs and faster transaction times.
- **Sign Protocol**: Utilized to manage attestation effectively, ensuring that all actions are verified and authenticated securely.

## Future Roadmap

- Integrate ERC4331 Account Abstraction
- Integrate EIP3074 AUTH and AUTHCALL opcodes after Pectra update
