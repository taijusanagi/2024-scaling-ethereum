# DeleGate

DeleGate is a smart contract wallet with attestation-based role management.

## Description

DeleGate utilizes the Sign Protocol's attestation to manage the roles of smart contract wallets. Only accounts with attestation can execute certain functions.

## Key Benefits

### Automation

DeleGate automates crucial wallet operations, enabling seamless transaction flows and interactions without manual oversight. This automation reduces human error and increases the efficiency of decentralized operations.

### Team Management

With role-based access control, DeleGate facilitates comprehensive team management. It allows organizations to define and enforce precise access controls and roles, making it ideal for managing large teams and multi-tiered permissions structures in decentralized projects.

### Transparency

Transparency is at the core of DeleGate. All transactions and access permissions are recorded on the blockchain, providing a clear and immutable audit trail. This transparency ensures that all actions are traceable and verifiable, enhancing trust and security for all users.

## Future Roadmap

- Integrate ERC4331 Account Abstraction
- Integrate EIP3074 AUTH and AUTHCALL opcodes after Pectra update
